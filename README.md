# ReimbursementSystem
This is the first project from Revature training.

This entails a basic reimbursement system with login validation and the ability for users to create and submit reimbursements. Finance managers can also approve or deny open reimbursement tickets. 

The project implements microservice architecture with a postgreSQL database backend connected to the front end by JDBC. The code is run on a tomcat server and the frontend uses basic javascript, html, css, and bootstrap.
